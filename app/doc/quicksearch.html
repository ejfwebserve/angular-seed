The seed contains a sample AngularJS application and is preconfigured to install the Angularframework and a bunch of development and testing tools for instant web development gratification. The seed app doesn't do much, just shows how to wire two controllers and views together. Getting StartedTo get you started you can simply clone the angular-seed repository and install the dependencies: PrerequisitesYou need git to clone the angular-seed repository. You can get git from here. We also use a number of Node.js tools to initialize and test angular-seed. You must have Node.jsand its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from here. Clone angular-seedClone the angular-seed repository using git: git clone https://github.com/angular/angular-seed.git cd angular-seedIf you just want to start a new project without the angular-seed commit history then you can do: git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/angular/angular-seed.git &lt;your-project-name&gt;The depth=1 tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data. Install DependenciesWe have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and Angular framework code. The tools helpus manage and test the application. We get the tools we depend upon via npm, the Node package manager. We get the Angular code via bower, a client-side code package manager. In order to run the end-to-end tests, you will also need to have theJava Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. Check out the section onend-to-end testing for more info. We have preconfigured npm to automatically run bower so we can simply do: npm installBehind the scenes this will also call bower install. After that, you should find out that you havetwo new folders in your project. node_modules - contains the npm packages for the tools we need app/bower_components - contains the Angular framework files Note that the bower_components folder would normally be installed in the root folder butangular-seed changes this location through the .bowerrc file. Putting it in the app foldermakes it easier to serve the files by a web server. Run the ApplicationWe have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to startthis server is: npm startNow browse to the app at localhost:8000/index.html. Directory Layoutapp/ --&gt; all of the source files for the application app.css --&gt; default stylesheet components/ --&gt; all app specific modules version/ --&gt; version related components version.js --&gt; version module declaration and basic &quot;version&quot; value service version_test.js --&gt; &quot;version&quot; value service tests version-directive.js --&gt; custom directive that returns the current app version version-directive_test.js --&gt; version directive tests interpolate-filter.js --&gt; custom interpolation filter interpolate-filter_test.js --&gt; interpolate filter tests view1/ --&gt; the view1 view template and logic view1.html --&gt; the partial template view1.js --&gt; the controller logic view1_test.js --&gt; tests of the controller view2/ --&gt; the view2 view template and logic view2.html --&gt; the partial template view2.js --&gt; the controller logic view2_test.js --&gt; tests of the controller app.js --&gt; main application module index.html --&gt; app layout file (the main html template file of the app) index-async.html --&gt; just like index.html, but loads js files asynchronously karma.conf.js --&gt; config file for running unit tests with Karma e2e-tests/ --&gt; end-to-end tests protractor-conf.js --&gt; Protractor config file scenarios.js --&gt; end-to-end scenarios to be run by ProtractorTestingThere are two kinds of tests in the angular-seed application: Unit tests and end-to-end tests. Running Unit TestsThe angular-seed app comes preconfigured with unit tests. These are written in Jasmine,which we run with the Karma test runner. We provide a Karma configuration file to run them. The configuration is found at karma.conf.js. The unit tests are found next to the code they are testing and have an _test.js suffix (e.g.view1_test.js). The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script: npm testThis script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will startwatching the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of themchanges.This is the recommended strategy; if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file thenyou receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality. You can also ask Karma to do a single run of the tests and then exit. This is useful if you want tocheck that a particular version of the code is operating as expected. The project contains apredefined script to do this: npm run test-single-run Running End-to-End TestsThe angular-seed app comes with end-to-end tests, again written in Jasmine. These testsare run with the Protractor End-to-End test runner. It uses native events and hasspecial features for Angular applications. The configuration is found at e2e-tests/protractor-conf.js. The end-to-end tests are found in e2e-tests/scenarios.js. Protractor simulates interaction with our web app and verifies that the application respondscorrectly. Therefore, our web server needs to be serving up the application, so that Protractor caninteract with it. Before starting Protractor, open a separate terminal window and run: npm startIn addition, since Protractor is built upon WebDriver, we need to ensure that it is installed andup-to-date. The angular-seed project is configured to do this automatically before running theend-to-end tests, so you don't need to worry about it. If you want to manually update the WebDriver,you can run: npm run update-webdriverOnce you have ensured that the development web server hosting our application is up and running, youcan run the end-to-end tests using the supplied npm script: npm run protractorThis script will execute the end-to-end tests against the application being hosted on thedevelopment server. Note:Under the hood, Protractor uses the Selenium Standalone Server, which in turn requiresthe Java Development Kit (JDK) to be installed on your local machine. Check this by runningjava -version from the command line. If JDK is not already installed, you can download it here. Updating AngularSince the Angular framework library code and tools are acquired through package managers (npm andbower) you can use these tools to easily update the dependencies. Simply run the preconfiguredscript: npm run update-depsThis will call npm update and bower update, which in turn will find and install the latestversions that match the version ranges specified in the package.json and bower.json filesrespectively. Loading Angular AsynchronouslyThe angular-seed project supports loading the framework and application scripts asynchronously.The special index-async.html is designed to support this style of loading. For it to work you mustinject a piece of Angular JavaScript into the HTML page. The project has a predefined script to helpdo this: npm run update-index-asyncThis will copy the contents of the angular-loader.js library file into the index-async.htmlpage. You can run this every time you update the version of Angular that you are using. Serving the Application FilesWhile Angular is client-side-only technology and it is possible to create Angular web apps thatdo not require a backend server at all, we recommend serving the project files using a localweb server during development to avoid issues with security restrictions (sandbox) in browsers. Thesandbox implementation varies between browsers, but quite often prevents things like cookies, XHR,etc to function properly when an HTML page is opened via the file:// scheme instead of http://. Running the App during DevelopmentThe angular-seed project comes preconfigured with a local development web server. It is a Node.jstool called http-server. You can start this web server with npm start, but you maychoose to install the tool globally: sudo npm install -g http-serverThen you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by running: http-server -a localhost -p 8000Alternatively, you can choose to configure your own web server, such as Apache or Nginx. Justconfigure your server to serve the files under the app/ directory. Running the App in ProductionThis really depends on how complex your app is and the overall infrastructure of your system, butthe general rule is that all you need in production are the files under the app/ directory.Everything else should be omitted. Angular apps are really just a bunch of static HTML, CSS and JavaScript files that need to be hostedsomewhere they can be accessed by browsers. If your Angular app is talking to the backend server via XHR or other means, you need to figure outwhat is the best way to host the static files to comply with the same origin policy if applicable.Usually this is done by hosting the files by the backend server or through reverse-proxying thebackend server(s) and web server(s). Continuous IntegrationTravis CITravis CI is a continuous integration service, which can monitor GitHub for new commits toyour repository and execute scripts such as building the app or running tests. The angular-seedproject contains a Travis configuration file, .travis.yml, which will cause Travis to run yourtests when you push to GitHub. You will need to enable the integration between Travis and GitHub. See theTravis website for instructions on how to do this. ContactFor more information on AngularJS please check out angularjs.org.
